          <p>Whether reminding you to leave to catch your flight, helping you <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-one-year-200-million/">find pictures</a> of your daughter’s recital, or suggesting the right <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/smart-reply-comes-to-inbox-by-gmail-on-the-web/">Smart Reply</a>,
            Google builds tools that help you make the world of information more accessible and useful. And at Google Play Music, we strive for the same.</p>
          <p>Building on our commitment to help you find the right music for any moment, today we’re introducing the new <a href="https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&amp;isi=691797987&amp;ius=googleplaymusic&amp;ad=1&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fmusic%3Futm_source%3Dglobal_soc%26utm_medium%3Dbp%26utm_content%3DNov0716%26utm_campaign%3DBlogpost%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-AC-global-none-all-soc-bp-mu-Blogpost-Nov0716-1-ThrillerBlogPost">Google Play Music</a>            — a fresh take on our music streaming service that is smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive. </p>
          <p>To deliver that, Google Play Music uses machine learning to figure out what music you like and then mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever
            you want tunes. Starting this week on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music&amp;hl=en&amp;utm_source=global_soc&amp;utm_medium=bp&amp;utm_content=Nov0716&amp;utm_campaign=Blogpost&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-soc-bp-ap-Blogpost-Nov0716-1-ThrillerBlogPost">Android</a>,

            the new experience will roll out globally (62 countries, to be precise).<br></p>
          <h3>DON’T THINK TWICE, IT’S ALL RIGHT</h3>
          <p>To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google’s understanding of your world, we’ve plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why
            you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack
            appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library.</p>

          <h3>WHAT YOU WANT? BABY I GOT IT</h3>
          <p>The new Google Play Music has a brand new home screen built just for you. Think of it as the ultimate personal DJ—one who listens not only to what you like, but also when you like it, so the music that you care about now is always at the top
            of your screen. Maybe that's your favorite new release on Friday, the dance party playlist you listen to after work, or more music from a new artist you've just fallen in love with. Regardless, it will be there waiting for you to press play.
            Powered by Google's machine learning systems and honed by our team of expert music curators, your experience will keep evolving (and improving) as we get to know you better.<br></p>
          <h3>PLEASE DON’T STOP THE MUSIC</h3>
          <p>No connection? Lost in the desert? No problem. Well...except for the lost part (try Google Maps for that). When you subscribe, you’ll always be prepped with an offline playlist based on what you’ve listened to recently. As long as you remember
            to charge your phone, you’ll have your favorite tunes, even if you forgot to download them ahead of time.</p>
          <p>From parks to airports to bars, whether you're walking, biking, or driving, the right music makes any moment better. With the new Google Play Music, we’re here to help with the perfect soundtrack for the things you do every day. After all, the
            only thing better than finding the perfect music is the perfect music finding you.<br></p>
