        <div class="rich-text">We use apps to call friends, send messages or listen to music. But sometimes, it’s hard to find exactly what you’re looking for. Today, we’re introducing a new way for you to search for information in your apps on your Android phone.<br><br>
          <p>With this new search mode, called In Apps, you can quickly find content from installed apps. To access this feature, go to the Google app on your Android phone and find the In Apps tab.</p>
        </div>

      </div>




      <div class="uni-paragraph">
        <div class="rich-text">Here are a few examples of what you can do with this new search mode:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Find your contacts and messages. </b>Easily find the friend you want to catch up with, or the name of the new sushi place that your friend told you about last month — just search for [sushi] and find the message.</li>
            <li><b>Listen</b>&nbsp;to your favorite running song or&nbsp;<b>watch</b>&nbsp;that sneezing panda video for the 15th time — all in one place.</li>
            <li><b>Stay organized</b>&nbsp;with your tasks and notes. Want to check off items on your grocery list? No problem, just search for [groceries].</li>
          </ul>Today this experience works with apps like Gmail, Spotify and YouTube. In the coming months, we’ll also be adding more apps, including Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, Evernote, Glide, Todoist and Google Keep. Searching your personal results happens
          entirely on your phone, so you can search even when you're not connected to WiFi or cellular data. Only you can see your personal results, and you can control what apps appear by going to Settings within the Google app.<br><br>And with the upcoming
          LG V20 phone, you'll be able to access the new In Apps mode directly with a dedicated shortcut on the homescreen and Second Screen. The LG V20 will be the first smartphone with this dedicated shortcut. In addition to searching apps you have
          downloaded, on the new LG V20 you’ll also be able to search LG’s pre-installed apps.</div>
