          scenes, and of course, the parties, you won’t miss a moment.<br><br>
          <h3>Hear from the designers</h3><br>
          <p>Fashion Week is all about the designers: their inspiration, their creativity and their new collections. As part of an experimental feature, dozens of international designers and brands like Marc Jacobs and Stella McCartney will be posting on
            Google Search, sharing inside information before, during and after the shows.</p>
