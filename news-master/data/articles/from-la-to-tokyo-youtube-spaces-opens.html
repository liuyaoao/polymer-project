        <div class="rich-text">We know that having a physical space to do your work matters, but it’s not just about where you work — it’s about what you create there. So today, we’re announcing special access to YouTube Spaces, YouTube’s global network of production studios,
          for eligible nonprofits to learn, connect, and create great content for YouTube. <br><br> Given that Google was <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/27/google-garage-anniversary/">started in a garage</a>, we’re more than familiar with the limits
          of physical space. As a nonprofit, it can be difficult to find access to great spaces for video production, especially when time, location, and money are constraining factors. As a result, space often becomes limiting, rather than limitless,
          to producing great content on YouTube.<br>
          <br>From LA to London, Tokyo to Mumbai, Berlin to São Paulo, YouTube Spaces empower nonprofits by providing them exclusive access to the best production resources around — all at no cost.&nbsp;All enrolled nonprofits with 1,000 or more subscribers
          are now eligible to apply for production access at YouTube Spaces. <br>
          <br>
          <p>But we’re also offering more than just physical space. In addition to our state-of-the-art production facilities, YouTube Spaces brings together creatives of all stripes. YouTube Spaces offers nonprofits opportunities to learn new skills through
            live workshops, as well as collaborate with the YouTube community through events, panels, screenings, and more!&nbsp;</p>
