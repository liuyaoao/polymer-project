        <div class="rich-text">Happy 13th birthday, <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/">Google Ad Grants</a>! We launched Ad Grants 13 years ago to offer nonprofits a free online advertising solution to share their causes with the world.&nbsp;<br><br>
          <p>Over the years, we’ve learned a lot together about what it means to be a nonprofit in the digital age. And as the industry landscape has changed, we’ve aimed to ensure that AdWords consistently helps to deliver your mission online.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br> We’ve celebrated the ability of groups to change the world — one day, one person, one place at a time. At the same time, we’ve also come to understand the challenges of the nonprofit sector by both listening to <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/success-stories/index.html#?modal_active=none">your stories</a>,
            as well as working directly alongside you. In doing so, we recognized that nonprofits struggle to find the time or resources to manage an AdWords account. So in 2015, we launched AdWords Express for Ad Grants as a part of Google for Nonprofits.

        <div class="rich-text">With nonprofits’ limited time and resources in mind, we created AdWords Express to be an automated advertising solution that serves the same effective ads on Google Search as standard AdWords. AdWords Express requires less ongoing maintenance
          than AdWords, while still delivering an exceptional experience for Ad Grantees.&nbsp;
          <p><br> With AdWords Express, your nonprofit can create an online ad quickly and easily, attracting more users to your website. There’s minimal ongoing management necessary, and AdWords Express runs and automatically optimizes your ads for you.
            Much like AdWords though, you can still reach customers on desktop computers and mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets), as well as review the effectiveness of your ads in your dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br> Sign up for Google Ad Grants <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/how-to-apply/index.html">here</a>.

          <hr>
          <p>To see if your nonprofit is eligible to participate, review the <a href="https://support.google.com/nonprofits/answer/3215869">Google for Nonprofits eligibility guidelines</a>. Google for Nonprofits offers organizations like yours free access
            to Google tools like Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Ad Grants, YouTube for Nonprofits and more. These tools can help you reach new donors and volunteers, work more efficiently, and tell your nonprofit’s story. Learn more and
            enroll <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/join/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
