          <h3><b>So you’re a savvy nonprofit that has mastered Ad Grants? Read on!&nbsp;</b></h3>You’re a group of community leaders who know the impact of data. And who know that technology can help you leverage that. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
          <p>Like many other businesses, it’s critical for nonprofits to translate clicks on ads into a meaningful action on their nonprofit’s website. These actions could be donations, event registrations, file downloads, volunteer sign-ups or form completions
            — whatever it is that you’re compelling users to do.</p>
          <p>Nonprofits like yours, however, often come to us with an important question: “How do we know if our Ad Grants account is actually resulting in these increased actions?” Great question!Our answer is simple, yet we hope it’s powerful too: Google
            Analytics.</p>
          <p>Google Analytics is your go-to tool for providing insights into user behavior, which can be used to inform Ad Grants, as well as website optimization. By syncing data and using AdGrants &amp; Analytics in tandem, you can boost the quality of
            traffic reaching your site and increase the chance of visitors completing a meaningful action on your NGO’s page. Best of all, Analytics can be used by nonprofits at no charge.</p>

          <p>To get started, we strongly recommend defining your team’s marketing objectives. (If you haven’t set up goals yet, check out <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6153083?hl=en">Smart Goals</a>, which were designed with groups
            like nonprofits in mind.)<br></p>
          <p>Then, link your Google Analytics account to your Google Ad Grants account to see your data. (Find out how to do so here:<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033961?hl=en"> Link Analytics and Ad Grants</a>). In doing so, you’ll
            unlock insights into your Ad Grants campaign. For instance, what happens after someone clicks on your Ad Grants ad and lands on your site? How does it differ by geographical region? Or how does user behavior differ between services offered?</p>
          <p>Going forward, you can also track your nonprofit’s marketing goals in Google Analytics to understand how traffic from your Ad Grants campaigns is converted to meaningful action on your website. To do so, import your goals into Ad Grants as conversions.</p>
          <p>Now, you’ll be able to see traffic quality data such as bounce rate, pages per session and average session duration for campaigns, ad groups, and keywords within Ad Grants. By adding goals as conversions, you’ll get the data you need to understand
            which text ads showing for keywords resonate best with your target audience.</p>
          <h3>Why, you might ask, is all this important for your nonprofit?</h3>
          <p>Take <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/success-stories/science-buddies.html">Science Buddies</a>, a nonprofit that was one of the earliest adopters of the Google Ad Grants program, joining in 2003. Science Buddies then received 171,000
            unique visits in 2004 via Ad Grants, with this number increasing by 4.5X to 773,000 unique visits in 2005. By 2006, Google Ad Grants had doubled the traffic to the website altogether. “Ad Grants really put us on the map!” said Kenneth Hess,
            President and Founder of Science Buddies.</p>
          <p>The takeaway here is that the more you optimize, the better chance you have of improving your <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454010?hl=en">quality score</a> — a key metric in an Ad Grants account! And more importantly, the
            better chance you have of authentically connecting with users who are trying to change the world along with with your nonprofit and you.&nbsp;<br></p>
