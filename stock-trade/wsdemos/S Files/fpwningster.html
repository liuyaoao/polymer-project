        firm offers to clients the &quot;Pulse Master&quot; program, a managed account 
        program in which the firm trades commodity futures contracts and other 
        derivative instruments on United States and non-United States exchanges 
        and markets. Dr. Zhu has spent over 9 years developing and refining his 
        PatternWorkshop systems. The Pulse Master which began trading customer 
        accounts in April 1999, is fully automated and as of March 2000, trades 
        100% systematically. Trading is primarily medium-term with a typical 
        trade lasting from one day to six weeks. The program uses four major 
        tools to detect price patterns and analyze market conditions: noise 
        analysis, non-linear topologic pattern recognition, pulse function 
        statistics, and neural genetic analysis. Patterns are recognized and 
        confirmed and signal one or more of the three main trading models, which 
        make up the platform. The program trades by implementing decisions 
        generated by the quantitative trading models. The program is well 
        diversified, trading 15 markets including U.S. Financial Markets, 
        Currencies, Indices, Industrial Metals, Energy and Agriculture Futures.
