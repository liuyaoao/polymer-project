        <div class="rich-text">Two weeks ago, we introduced <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/04/tilt-brush.html">Tilt Brush</a>, a new app that enables artists to use virtual reality to paint the 3D space around them. Part virtual reality, part physical reality,
          it can be difficult to describe how it feels without trying it firsthand. Today, we bring you a little closer to the experience of painting with Tilt Brush using the powers of the web in a new Chrome Experiment titled <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/">Virtual Art Sessions</a>.<br>

      <div class="uni-paragraph">
        <div class="rich-text">Virtual Art Sessions lets you observe six world-renowned artists as they develop blank canvases into beautiful works of art using Tilt Brush. Each session can be explored from start to finish from any angle, including the artist’s perspective
          – all viewable right from the browser.<br>
          <br> Participating artists include illustrator <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/artists/christoph-niemann/">Christoph Niemann</a>, fashion illustrator <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/artists/katie-rodgers/">Katie Rodgers</a>,
          sculptor <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/artists/andrea-blasich/">Andrea Blasich</a>, installation artist <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/artists/seung-yul-oh/">Seung Yul Oh</a>, automotive concept designer
          <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/artists/harald-belker/">Harald Belker</a>, and street artist duo <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/artists/yok-and-sheryo/">Sheryo &amp; Yok</a>. The artists’ unique approaches
          to this new medium become apparent when seeing them work inside their Tilt Brush creations. Watch this behind-the-scenes video to hear what the artists had to say about their experience:<br> Virtual Art Sessions makes use of Google Chrome’s
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/v8/">V8 Javascript engine</a> for high-performance processing power to render large volumes of data in real time. This includes point cloud data of the artist’s physical form, 3D geometry data of the artwork,
          and position data of the VR controllers. It also relies on Chrome’s support of <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/">WebM video</a> and <a href="https://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl">WebGL</a> to produce the 360° representations of the artists
          and artwork – the artist portrayals alone require the browser to draw over 200,000 points at 30 times a second. For a deeper look, read the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/case-study/art-sessions">technical case study</a>          or browse the project code that is available open source from the site’s <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/#/tech">tech page</a>.<br>
          <br>
          <p>
            We hope this experiment provides a window into the world of painting in virtual reality using Tilt Brush. We are excited by this new medium and hope the experience leaves you feeling the same. Visit <a href="http://g.co/VirtualArtSessions">g.co/VirtualArtSessions</a>            to start exploring.</p>
