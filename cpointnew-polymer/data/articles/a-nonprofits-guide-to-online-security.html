THE BAD GUYS: MALICIOUS ACTIONS/TERMS

<br><br></h3>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Advanced Fee Fraud (419 scams):</i> A technique which tricks users into sending or paying money to fraudsters on the promise of receiving greater rewards afterwards. It is most commonly associated with Nigeria, and 419 is the section of
              the Nigerian <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-Part%20VI%20%20to%20the%20end.htm">legal code</a> that covers this fraud.</li>
            <li><i>Botnet:</i> A network of computers that are infected with malicious software without users’ knowledge, used to send viruses and spam to other computers.</li>
            <li><i>Malware:</i> Malicious software with the purpose of infecting devices and systems, gathering personal information, gaining access to systems or disrupting the operations of the device or systems. Essentially, any software that maliciously
              alters or compromises the system or device.</li>
            <li><i>Phishing / Social Engineering Attack:</i> An attempt by hackers who pose as trustworthy individuals or businesses in order to get your personal information such as usernames, passwords, and financial information.</li>
            <li><i>Trojans:</i> Malicious programs posing as or bundled with legitimate ones, which are designed to compromise your system. They are usually installed on computers from opening attachments in scam emails or by visiting infected websites. The
              term comes from the Trojan Horse in Greek mythology.<br></li>

          <h3>THE GOOD GUYS: ONLINE SAFETY TERMS</h3><br>
          <ul>
            <li><i>[Internet] Cookie:</i> A piece of data from a visited website and stored in the user's web browser in order to remember information that the user has entered or engaged with such as items in a shopping basket on an e-commerce site.</li>
            <li><i>Encryption: </i>The process of encoding data, messages, or information, such that only authorized parties can read it.</li>
            <li><i>Firewall:</i> A security system used to block hackers, viruses, and other malicious threats to your computer. It does this by acting as a barrier, acting on predetermined rules, which allows trusted traffic but blocks untrusted or non-secure
              traffic.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><i>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</i> is the protocol for secure communications over a computer network used on the Internet. It essentially provides authentication of the website and the web servers associated with it.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><i>Transport Layer Security (TLS):</i> TLS is a protocol that encrypts and delivers mail securely, both for inbound and outbound mail traffic. It helps prevent eavesdropping between mail servers – keeping your messages private while they're
              moving between email providers.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><i>Two Factor Authentication / Two Step Verification:</i><i> </i>A method of using an additional process to verify your identity online. It combines both ‘something you know’ (like a password) and ‘something you have’ (like your phone or security
              key) — similar to withdrawing money from an ATM/cash machine, where you need both your PIN and your bank card.<br></li>
          </ul><br>That’s a wrap for now! Pass on these tips to your nonprofit partners to stay safe and secure online, so you can focus on what matters most: changing the world.&nbsp;
