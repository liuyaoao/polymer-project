        <div class="rich-text">YouTube has over a billion users. That’s almost one-third of all people on the Internet. And everyday those users watch hundreds of millions of hours of video, racking up billions of views – which are now billions of opportunities to do good.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            We’re excited to announce a brand new tool that U.S. nonprofits can utilize — donation cards on YouTube! Donation cards make it even simpler to raise money for your cause by allowing your viewers to donate directly from your YouTube video. Even better
            — Google covers the processing fees, so your organization will receive 100% of the money donated. Donation cards on YouTube are currently available for U.S. nonprofits and creators, but we look forward to expanding into other countries, so
            nonprofits and creators can digitally fundraise across the globe.&nbsp;</p>

      <div class="uni-paragraph">
        <div class="rich-text">Using donation cards, YouTube creators can also now raise money through their content to both support your cause and make their videos more impactful! Donation cards for creators in the U.S. enable their subscribers and viewers to donate directly
          from their videos. Creators can choose any United States, IRS-validated 501(c)3 public nonprofit organization.&nbsp;Your nonprofit will receive 100% of the money donated.<br><br>
