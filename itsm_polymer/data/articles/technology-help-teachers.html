        <div class="rich-text"><i>This week our <a href="http://www.google.com/edu">Google for Education</a> team will be joining thousands of educators at the annual <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/">ISTE conference</a>. Follow along on their <a href="http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleForEdu">Twitter</a> for the latest news and updates. -Ed.</i>
          <p><br> Great teachers inspire us, listen to us and learn from us; they bring the most mundane subjects to life. Technology can help great teachers do what they do best—stimulating minds and fostering skills in the next generation—and make learning
            even more rewarding for students. So we’re excited by the <a href="http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/06/updates-from-iste-4-new-tools-to-help.html">updates and improvements to our tools for the classroom</a> we’re announcing this
            week at the <a href="https://conference.iste.org/2016/">ISTE conference</a>, one of the largest education technology gatherings in the world.<br></p>
          <h3>
Expeditions for all</h3> Since we launched the Expeditions Pioneer Program last September, more than a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MQ9yG_QfDA">million students</a> from 11 countries have taken one of our 200+ virtual reality trips—from the Great Barrier
          Reef, to the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu. Today, we’re making Expeditions available to everyone. To get started, all teachers need to do is download the <a href="http://www.google.com/edu/expeditions">Expeditions app</a> onto a set of devices
          and choose where in the world they want to take their class. The app is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.expeditions">available today for Android</a> and will be available for iPhones and iPads soon. <br>
          <br> While Expeditions can be used with many of the devices schools or students already have, <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/GoogleExpeditions">Best Buy Education</a> will also be making Expeditions kits available for schools to purchase. These
          kits will contain everything teachers need to bring their classes on amazing Expeditions: a tablet, virtual reality viewers and a router to connect them all. <br>

          <h3>Google Cast for Education</h3> Sharing information on the classroom’s big screen helps students learn from one another. But today, students have to physically connect their computers to the projector to share their screens with the class. To open classroom collaboration
          and bring projecting into the 21st century, we’re announcing <a href="http://g.co/castforedu">Google Cast for Education</a>, a free Chrome app that lets students and teachers share their screens wirelessly from everywhere in the classroom, no
          new hardware required. Cast for Education carries video and audio across complex school networks, has built-in controls for teachers, and is integrated with <a href="http://www.google.com/edu/classroom">Google Classroom</a>.<br>

          <h3>Quizzes in Google Forms</h3>Getting feedback helps students learn and teachers teach. But grading tests and quizzes is time-consuming; teachers often have to take time away from other tasks to do it, and if it’s not done promptly, everyone misses out on the opportunity
          to learn from the things students got wrong. Starting today,&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/ZfwK68">Quizzes in Google Forms</a>&nbsp;will grade multiple choice and checkbox questions automatically—so teachers can spend less time grading work and
          more time teaching.&nbsp;<br><br>
          <p>Teachers can set correct answers in Forms and even add review materials in the form of explanations, supplemental websites, or review videos—so students can get quick, informative feedback on how to improve. Plus, teachers can get an instant
            snapshot on what their students understand, so they know which lessons need more explanation or what to teach next.</p>

          that schools can now purchase at a discount: <a href="http://explaineverything.com/chromebooks/">Explain Everything</a>, <a href="https://www.soundtrap.com/edu/">Soundtrap</a>, and <a href="https://www.wevideo.com/education">WeVideo</a>. These
