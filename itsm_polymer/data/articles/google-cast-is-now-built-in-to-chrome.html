          <p>Two years ago we launched <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd">Google Cast</a>, an extension for Chrome that allowed you to show content from your favorite websites on the best screen
            in your home — your TV — using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chromecast/tv/#?discover">Chromecast</a>. &nbsp;Whether watching your favorite show on Netflix, or sharing a photo slideshow at a family gathering, Google Cast makes
            it easy to extend the web to the big screen. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Since we launched Chromecast, we’ve been working to make casting even better. We've launched <a href="https://chrome.googleblog.com/2015/09/how-to-love-chromecast-lot.html">new Cast devices like Chromecast Audio</a> and partnered with other
            manufacturers to make <a href="https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/03/introducing-vizio-p-series-display-with.html">Cast-enabled TVs</a> and <a href="https://chrome.googleblog.com/2016/01/more-fun-in-living-room-with-android-tv.html">speakers</a>.
            &nbsp;We’ve also made significant improvements in quality, with the vast majority of casting sessions now in HD.</p>
          <p>Casting from Chrome has become incredibly popular: In the past month alone, people have casted more than 38 million times from Chrome, watching and listening to more than 50 million hours of content.</p>
          <p>Today we’re happy to announce that Google Cast is now built fully into Chrome, and anyone can now Cast without having to install or configure anything. &nbsp;When you’re on websites that are <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/chrome_sender">integrated with Cast</a>,
            you’ll see the Cast icon appear when you’re on the same network as a Cast device — and with a couple of clicks you can view your content on your TV or listen to music on your speakers:</p>
          <!-- <p><img alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-15 at 10.49.32 AM.png" height="431" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xdsYJZN3lUSPghQDsrQB77f0seUYkDsaE8gjzvjJQNHk4j8E-ffRchqtJhsFo40RzWueDho-QgZ3wn6-kWjh9UT6yy4gs0Zfdg2KNIWlsLIUnmf5iu-OPUGXRpkaw2V62Ghf_xz7"
                width="624"></p> -->
          <p>You can also view websites that are not integrated with Cast on your TV by selecting the “Cast…” menu item from the Chrome menu:<br><br><img height="297" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f4MozMi1ux5lxPVUNfIJpZdaIqtqCNfNnMFF3Y5wLe2raPSKzm_UbJb7JqsehMiU4GmJcqIE3svV-LQsLeVDXXIsoTFF2R0cXTQUWcllkKM70_KhdUdljhlXWTqF5EyL9FXLEyGw"
                width="240"></p>
          <p>And you can now cast to even more places — including sharing with participants on a video call in <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/6320939?hl=en">Google Hangouts</a> and the <a href="http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/06/teach-and-learn-from-everywhere-in.html">Cast for Education</a>            <a href="http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/06/teach-and-learn-from-everywhere-in.html">app, </a>which we <a href="http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/06/teach-and-learn-from-everywhere-in.html">announced recently</a>. &nbsp;Now
            you can share your presentation with your coworkers during a Hangout or to your peers in the classroom.</p>With Google Cast and Chrome, you can share what you love to watch with those around you. We’re excited to make this <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/2998338">available to everyone</a>.
          &nbsp;To get the new built-in Cast functionality all you need to do is make sure you have the latest version of Chrome.</div>
