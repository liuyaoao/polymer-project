/**
 * This annotation type is used on classes that need to declare that they extend
 * multiple classes (which is not possible in Java).
 * 
 * <p>
 * In JSweet, most of the time, the API definitions use classes instead of
 * interfaces by choice, in order to be able to define properties with fields.
 * This way the syntax and use of the API is simpler and closer to the targeted
 * code. However, in some cases, the API would require multiple inheritance,
 * which is then specified through this annotation. This annotation reflects
 * that the extended class members have been duplicated into the extending
 * class, and that the transpiler shall not complain when using a dynamic casts
 * between the extended and extending classes.
